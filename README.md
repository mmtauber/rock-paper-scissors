# rock-paper-scissors
A rock, paper, scissors implementation using the strategy design pattern. Using the strategy pattern makes the codebase easily extendable. This functionality would be much easier to add: http://thefuntimesguide.com/images/blogs/rockpaperscissors.jpg

It is also worth noting that this project is also an interesting candidate for genetic algorithms. I have not included a genetic solution to the problem, but I thought it was worth sharing. Instead of implementing a na√Øve 'random choice' player we could implement a genetic algorithm strategy. Each turn would represent a 'generation' of the algorithm. We assign a 'fitness' value to the algorithm. This allows us to measure how successful that generation was. In this case, a 'win' would have the highest fitness value, while a 'loss' would have the lowest. The genes with a high fitness survive and are included in the next generation. The expected output in this example, where one player always chooses 'PAPER', would cause our genetic algo player to converge on always choosing 'SCISSORS'. 

A fun example of this can be found here: http://www.blprnt.com/smartrockets/

In the above example a rocket's fitness is measured by how close it got to the target.
